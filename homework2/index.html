                    1. In Core 1: Interaction, I mostly used html and css to create a collection of websites. I have very little experience working with Javascript; however, code with JS was mostly done by Chat GPT last semester.

                    2. Core 1: Interaction is the only class that I have taken where I experienced HTML/ CSS/ JS

                    3. I enjoyed working with simple animations and hover effects.

                    4. I felt like I was often not deliberate with my coding. So a lot of times, I was, “Why is it working?” or “Why is it not working?” I was also really confused with arranging text, and images at the exact place that I wanted them to be.

                <p>
                    5. I am more nervous than excited about learning how to code. My Core 1: Interaction professor wasn’t really clear when teaching the basics of coding. Therefore, it was mostly self-taught last semester, which made me face a lot of confusion and frustration.  I feel that structured class lectures and in-class work time can help to reduce this anxiety.

                    6. I feel like I will use coding when I make a website that has archives/ portfolios of my work.

                                -I found this website while I was researching for some web inspiration for Core 1: Interaction project. This project is done by a Korean graphic designer, Cho Hyunseo. Pygmalion Project is a collection of work generated by AI based on Cho Hyunseo’s input of 10,000 images that she finds beautiful. I found the project itself very interesting. Furthermore, I liked the beauty of randomness revealed through this project.

                                -I started to have an interest in graphic design through k-pop. Whenever any artists were releasing an album, I would carefully look at the promotion posters, album covers, and the album itself. Gagarin Works has designed a number of albums of my favorite artists.

                                -I enjoy watching designs and artwork with some kind of playfulness and whimsicality. I also like adding entertaining elements in my works. Dom, the designer of Things I Have Drawn, shows both creativity and playfulness through his photoshopped images. His works are inspiring since whenever I see his works, I feel imagination turning into reality.
